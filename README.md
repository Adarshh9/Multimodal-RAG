# Multimodal RAG System - Leveraging Whisper, CLIP, LLAVA, and FAISS for Enhanced Media Retrieval and Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Multimodal RAG System** is an advanced AI solution for processing, indexing, and retrieving data across different media formats (video, audio, and text). This project integrates cutting-edge models (Whisper, CLIP, LLAVA, and FAISS) to create a system capable of high-accuracy content understanding and retrieval, supporting contextual, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries across multimedia content.

## Key Components and Their Functions

1. **Whisper - Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - **Role**: Converts audio to text, supporting multilingual transcription and accurate transcription across varied audio environments.
   - **Implementation**: Transcribes audio from videos, aligning spoken content with visual frames for seamless multimedia processing.
  
2. **CLIP - Image and Text Embedding**
   - **Role**: Generates embeddings for images and text, allowing cross-modal understanding and retrieval based on visual or textual queries.
   - **Implementation**: Extracts visual embeddings from video frames or standalone images, enabling cross-modal querying.

3. **LLAVA - Vision-Language Model for Multimodal Tasks**
   - **Role**: Enables tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, like answering image-related questions or summarizing content.
   - **Implementation**: Works with Whisper and CLIP to provide multimodal responses, allowing users to ask context-specific questions about media content.

4. **FAISS - Fast Similarity Search**
   - **Role**: An efficient tool for similarity search and clustering, crucial for high-speed, scalable search across embeddings.
   - **Implementation**: Indexes processed media (text, image, and audio embeddings) for rapid, contextually accurate retrieval.

## Additional Features and Innovations

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Extends functionality for real-time indexing of new media, useful for live content scenarios.
- **Enhanced Metadata Tagging**: Custom tags based on content type, objects, or themes for improved categorization and search precision.
- **Cross-Modal Search and Retrieval**: Allows users to query across formats (e.g., text-to-image retrieval), enhancing interactivity.

## **Potential Use Cases**

- **Digital Media Libraries**: Enables efficient archiving, indexing, and retrieval of large multimedia libraries, allowing users to search by text, keywords, or spoken content in audio/video files.

- **Corporate Knowledge Bases**: Facilitates quick access to organizational media assets, like training videos and webinars, through specific topic-based queries, boosting productivity and learning.

- **Content Moderation**: Real-time monitoring of multimedia content ensures adherence to community standards, aiding platforms in maintaining brand safety and regulatory compliance.

- **Educational Platforms**: Empowers educational systems by providing learners and educators with rapid access to multimedia materials via topic-based or natural language queries, enriching the learning experience.

## Building a Multimodal RAG System: Workflow and Architecture

### Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of five core components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects and preprocesses multimedia data for compatibility with downstream processing.
2. **Data Processing & Embedding**: Uses models to convert media types into embeddings that capture semantic meaning.
3. **Indexing**: Stores embeddings for efficient retrieval.
4. **Retrieval**: Finds relevant content based on user queries.
5. **Response Generation**: Formats search results for user presentation.

### Detailed Workflow

#### A. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- **Input Types**: Text files, audio files, and image files.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Tokenize text, transcribe audio with **Whisper**, standardize images with **OpenCV** or **PIL**.
- **Tools & Tech**: Python, Librosa, Whisper API.

#### B. Data Processing and Embedding Generation
- **CLIP Model**: Embeds images and text.
- **Whisper Model**: Transcribes audio to text and generates embeddings.
- **Tools & Tech**: CLIP, Whisper, Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS.

#### C. Indexing
- **FAISS**: Stores and indexes embeddings for rapid, high-dimensional similarity searches.
- **Tools & Tech**: FAISS, Numpy, MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for metadata).

#### D. Retrieval
- **Query Processing**: Converts queries into embeddings.
- **Multimodal Search**: Uses FAISS for similarity search across media types.
- **Tools & Tech**: FAISS, FastAPI/Flask (API endpoints).

#### E. Response Generation and User Interface

## Additional Considerations and Unique Enhancements

- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically index new data uploads.
- **Contextual Re-Ranking**: Re-rank results based on recent interactions.
- **Multilingual Support**: Whisper and CLIP allow multilingual querying.
- **Cross-Format Queries**: Query with one format (e.g., image) to retrieve results across others.
  
## Deployment and Scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment.
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/GCP with GPU support for embedding generation.
- **Scalability**: Deploy FAISS across multiple nodes or use a vector database like Pinecone.

By following this architecture and workflow, the Multimodal RAG System efficiently processes and retrieves multimedia data, providing an innovative, high-performance search experience across diverse content types.
